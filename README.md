# VirtualCasino

This program reads a user's name and virtual currency balance from a file (or creates a new user and balance if it is a new player), then allows that user to access a virtual casino where they can place bets while playing two different card games. 

This was an old assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with inheritance. If you'd like to view the instructions for the assignment, they are located in the "Assignment_1.md" file.

Some of the classes in this program were written and provided to us by professor Jordan Kidney. These classes are: Card, CardHand, Deck, Menu, and MenuOption.
